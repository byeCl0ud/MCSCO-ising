This is for input and output structure for this 2-D Monte Carlo code.

WARNING:  HP Computers had segementation fault with original
          array declaration set to high value. It was actually
          larger than EWS HP memory allotment.

*****INPUT STRUCTURE is 3 LINES
1        15         1         0.00     ! Lattice, L, V_nn, mu
10.0     0.10      200                 ! T_initial, T_final, TSTEPS
400      1089561                       ! ntimes, iseed for RNG


LINE 1 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
LINE 1: MC code works for LATTICE=
  1= square
  2= triangular
  3= rhombohedral

LINE 1: Box Size L=
  5 = repeated 5   sites per direction
  10= repeated 10  sites per direction

LINE 1: V_nn=  magnetiude and sign  of nearest neighbor interaction
  V = -1   FM Ising Model
  V = +1  AFM Ising Model

LINE 1: mu= chemical potential difference
 mu = 0  no external field (or 50% up and 50% dn)
LINE 1 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

LINE 2 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
LINE 2:  T_initial = starting temperature (CANNOT BE ZERO !!!!)
  T_initial = 10  temperature in units of V_nn 

LINE 2:  T_final   = final    temperature (CANNOT BE ZERO !!!!)
  T_initial = 1   temperature in units of V_nn 

LINE 2:  TSTEPS = steps in temperature
  TSTEPS = 10  (MUST BE INTEGER)
LINE 2 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


LINE 3 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
LINE 3:  ntimes = Integer  Number of sample for avg. 
   ntimes= 125       (e.g.)

LINE 3:   iseed = directly change RNG seed to do multiple runs.
    iseed= 1089561   (e.g.)

*****OUTPUT STRUCTURE

file1.out  
   Temperature, time, Energy/atom, Magnetization/atom  

file2.out 
   T, E/atom, deltaE/atom, Mag/atom, dM/atom,  Cv/atom

file3.out
   T
   configuration given by 1 (0) for up(dn) or A(B)
   * Note that the printout is for L+2 because it includes 
   * the buffer layer (arising from the Boundary conditions)
   * around the L-sized simulation cell.

file4.out
   T, # of raises accepted, # of lowering accepted, # of rejected
         (SUM OF LAST THREE = constant = number of attempts)
